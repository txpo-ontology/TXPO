Toxic Process Ontology (TXPO)

Toxic process ontology (TXPO) systematizes terms involving toxicity courses and processes.
TXPO classifies 'Process' into  'Primitive process' and 'Process sequence'.  'Process sequence' includes toxic courses and 'primitive process' includes toxic course dependent processes.

TXPO focuses on functioning processes in the liver to protect organisms from toxic actions.

Entities in the top layer refer to the upper ontology, Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) . In the biomedical dependent entities, TXPO imports existing terms and reuses them from biomedical ontologies: UBERON, Cell Ontology, NCBI Taxon, ChEBI, Gene Ontology, OGG, INOH, HINO, NCIT, DOID and Relational ontology (RO).

In applied work, we have developed a prototype of TOXPILOT, a toxic process interpretable knowledge system. TOXPILOT provides visualization maps of the toxic course, which facilitates capturing the comprehensive picture for understanding toxicity mechanisms.
